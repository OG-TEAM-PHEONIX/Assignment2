              JD Eru currently lives on Wajuk Country, otherwise known as Perth WA. JD was born in Taranaki Aotearoa and moved to Australia 
              in 1999. She has worked in the banking sector for the past 6 years and prior to that worked in travel. 
              D’s interest in IT has increased over the last few years, her natural curiosity and need to understand “How things work” has 
              driven her to pursue a career in IT through Open Universities Australia and RMIT, she is currently a member of Team Phoenix. 
              JD hasn’t yet decided what she wants to pursue in the world of IT but is particularly interested in data science.
