              William is a student at RMIT through Open Universities currently studying Introduction to IT as a part of Team Phoenix and Introduction to Programming. 
              Born and raised in North-West Tasmania, Will was lucky enough to experience other cultures through his multicultural family: 
              his mother, Filipino, and his father, British and German. His favorite pastimes include volleyball, gaming and watching an abhorrent number of films and shows. 
              His interest in IT began at a young age, where technology always seemed like a case of ‘out with the old, 
              in with the new’ so with his spare time he’d enjoy taking apart old phones or laptops, to look inside and try to understand how those devices ran. 
              Video games also play a big part in his interest. Will has previously completed a certificate IV in Web Design through TasTafe Online but otherwise has no experience yet. <br><br>
              More information about Will is available <a href="https://s398willc.github.io/iit.as1/" target="_blank">here</a>
