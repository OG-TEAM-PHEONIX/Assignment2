      <p>
        To gain an understanding of what occurs on a day-to-day basis for an IT professional an interview was conducted with Daniel Stone. <br><br>

        Daniel has been in the IT industry for 7 years. After graduating the University of South Australia with a bachelor's degree (Honors)
        in Computer Science Daniel began working at Saab Australia as a Software Engineer and is now the Associate Software Functional 
        Manager of Engineering and Technology at Lockheed Martin Australia Rotary and Mission Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel holds a senior position at Lockheed Martin. A typical day consists of both technical and general people leading work 
        with 30 direct reports. The technical tasks include; writing code, moving tickets, attending scrums, acting as either a project 
        lead or working with the project lead, reading specifications, troubleshooting and debugging in the integration lab, 
        helping junior engineers and integrating technology and testing. While the technical duties account for 80% of the roles workload 
        the general tasks account for 50% of Daniels time. These additional management tasks include; timesheet management, interactions 
        with HR, Career development plans, Hiring, Firing, the graduate programme and community programs such as university work, 
        engineers in the classroom and various school-based STEM programmes.

          As a Software Manager project delivery is also a significant part of Daniels workload and can often be the most challenging. 
          Problems and errors frequently arise during test deliveries with customers as these projects have previously only been in the 
          research and development prototype stage. Overcoming these challenges with customers and other stakeholders is vital.

          <h4>
            Interviewer: Jordan Smithers and JD ensured
            <br>IT Professional: Daniel Stone
          </h4>
          IT Professional: Daniel Stone
          <br><br>
          JS: I guess I'll just start with the questions, I suppose, and get it out of the way. Let's get move. So Daniel, can you please tell me about your IT work? What exactly do you do?
          <br><br>
          DS: Okay. So I'm a -- I've had a couple of different roles. I've been in IT for 7 years. So I'm a few things at the moment. I work at Lockheed Mun as an associate functional manager in software. So I'm a line manager, I look after 21 early career engineers, graduates and people that have come off a gradual program. I do time sheets, HA interruptions, finance interactions, career development, performance reviews, hiring, firing, all of those types of things. That's 20% of my role. The other 80% is split between leading software teams and software development. So that's the standard stuff we are right in core moving dura tickets around pair programming with more junior engineers, reading specifications, integrating new technologies, testing it. The other part of that, which I do a lot of, and I'm normally the face for my project team. I do a lot of the senior stakeholders, executive and government and international delegation demonstrations and presentations. So my stakeholder management is probably one of the stronger skills because I do that naturally. That's -- I'm a people person, and engineering is something I have to work harder, that isn't natural. I'm not one of those naturally gifted people at math. So I operate as a hybrid. So at my work, most engineers are really strong on the code and really weak on the people. So I -- my goal is to not be too good at anything. So I'm averaged in a lot of areas. So I feel gaps much like no more gaps. So I end up doing all of the presentation start stuff. I'm probably pretty good at presentations. I've had some formal training and I've done about 2,000 of them. So yes, I was doing a demo to the Chief Operating Officer a couple of weeks ago for Lockheed Mountain. So the key thing there is that he is the second to top employee out of our 135,000 organization, and he came down and did a 101 demo with me in Camera. So like I've got a bit of penetration through the organization. I've done Head of Air Force like Head of Navy, all of these people. So I'm a bit blended. I'm probably nontypical. So yes, it's a very general answer. I do a lot of things, I suppose.
          <br><br>
          JS: Yes. Yes, that sort of covers the first 2 questions, I guess, about the industry working and everything. So we also move on to the third question because you did actually got us a lot of information for that first one. What other kinds of work do you have to do? Is there anything that's sort of like out of the norm that you sometimes have to do or...
          <br><br>
          DS: Yes. So we do STEM engagements with educational institutions like high schools and universities. We do career spares. So science alive and like the University corepresand engineers in the classroom for year 10 and 11 students. I I probably have a lot of university impact because I've got a secondary role as on that lecture. So I generally pick up those career things because I hire. So I teach software engineers doing Bachelor of IT and then I hire them. And so I have like one of -- I'm the only person in the organization with like end-to-end. I see first year students, and I've got some working in my team right now.That's right. It's nice -- it's a nice circular economy, right? Because I'm teaching people that I'd want to employ my teams and then I employ them. I don't get a referral bonus because that's unethical, but..Yes. So there's lots of things. There's crisis management with whenever you're dealing with people, there will be acute health issues or there will be changes in living conditions that you need to help with -- so I work quite closely with Human Resources business partners. One of my employees had to move into state suddenly because his golfer up and left and said, I'm not -- she's a doctor. I'm not working in Australian hospitals, I hate them. So she just left on the weekend. -- much to another state, and he listed together, but he's like, "I need to work from home to sort this out. And so we have to challenge some of those policies and got it over the line in the end, but there's a lot of HR interactions reading documents like none of this has to do with software. I studied computer science on this, so I'm a soft for engineer. All of this stuff is bolt-on and a lot of leadership training as well because I'm in a role where I have to act as a shaped for a large number of people, probably 30 people have got direct leadership impact on. That's a lot. That's a big team. So yes, I end up doing probably 10% of my time is training as well. So that probably covers all of the exabits...
          <br><br>
          JS: That's very nice. So I heard you mentioned that you've done work with the Army, the Navy, HR, et cetera, et cetera. What are all the different people you interact with in your work? Can you tell us about them?
          <br><br>
          DS: So you're talking about like different user groups or stakeholder groups...
          <br><br>
          JS: Yes. Just different people you interact with really Yes.
          <br><br>
          DS: So there's a lot of interaction internally with executives, middle management project leads software tasking leads. So that will be like my team lead, if I'm not the team leak, Usually, I am, but not at the moment. I've got a team lead that tasks me with software work technical work to do. With my immediate team, so I'm in a scrum team with 8 people. So there's 8 engineers working together. We all sit next to each other and do all of our agile, like our sprint reviews, our standups in the morning for 5 minutes to explain what we're stuck on. That type of thing. So I spend a lot of time with those people, 75%, 80% of my time is with that group of 8 and then
         
          the other 20% of my time is with project managers. I talk to a lot because I'm one of the more senior leaders in the organization. So unlike the project manager will say something like we need this to happen. Daniel, can you come talk to me. Is this even possible? And how should we do it? How should I communicate it to the team to not upset people. So I do a bit of middle management comms and executive comm stuff. So we'll get -- I interact with invest internal investors. So the Chief Operating Officer is the only reason Lockheed Martin Australia really exists like as a whole concept. So 1,000 of us have a job because he wanted to invest in Air Force projects in Australia a long time ago. So for him to come down and see it and for me to be put on the front row, I suppose, to justify and demonstrate that investment and its benefits. That's like a very high-level high-risk, high-reward type of interaction. And probably most importantly, I interact a lot with customers. So I interact with Air Force operators and naval operators a bit, so especially Air Force because I'm air force targeted. So there will be people that are going to use the system on designing. Then there's the people that actually don't know anything but did 25 years ago. They are the ones that make the decision. So these are the sea members in defense that often have really good people skills there and management executive type, but they don't use the system so they rely on their panel of experts. They bring along, but you talk to them. So they're sort of, I don't know, like an executive customer stakeholder group. They're the people that sign and perform that says here's $1 billion.And I suppose I've got a very broad role. I touch a lot of the organization, as you're probably working out. I work a lot with early careers hiring graduates, I run the graduate program for software engineering in Australia, some for me. So I talk to people in Williamstown, people in here also a little bit in Perth, Melbourne, Canberra, -- we've got people spread out everywhere and of course, multiple locations in underlaid 4, I think, where we do hiring and training. So I end up talking to a lot of facilities, people, a lot of hardware engineers and systems engineers to see if we can trade desks or trade people that want to swap jobs instead of losing them? Like do you want to do some work that's widely different but still under the Lockheed Martin umbrella. So that's like a fantasy AFL like you're training people when you're trying to get the best drape, but also not make people save. So there's lots of interaction with my peers that aren't software that's pretty wet as well. But yes.
          <br><br>
          JS: Yes, you've got -- it's all about communication. I think it's a people skilled thing. Okay. So you actually managed to answer the next 2 questions in that which...
          <br><br>
          DS: I’ve read the list of question -- sorry about
          <br><br>
          JS: That's that's making it much easier. So we'll go to the next slide. What aspects of your work do you spend most of your time on? So more so like that 80% of your...
          <br><br>
          DS: So I would say software development tasks would still be half of my role. So that's just riding curve, not necessarily writing code. I'll be honest, I do keep that. I do a little bit of that. But software development in like a junior engineer will come up to below Daniel. This is broken I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. And I'm like, "All right, I'm not going to -- I won't necessarily touch the keyboard, but I'll do the thinking with them. I'm like, okay, so let's go into the
          
          integration line. We're going to turn these bits of. I'm going to tend ibid troubleshooting, debugging and are like, okay, if you see this type of problem, I'm not sure, but I know who is sure, and that's Gary. He's on desk 4 over there, talk ask him about how to resolve this integration issue. So that's sort of, I'd call it, core software engineering piece. So it's not just coencoatings the easy bit, right? It's making up work. So it makes the requirements. That's the nontrivial it. Anyone can write code, code can be cracked and still run. But like does the system work and does, in my situation, I work on safety critical systems, am I making something that stops Australians from being killed, so it's important that it works.Sort of works or work sometimes. Some of my grads think working sometimes is okay, and I remind them that people will die, and then they changed their attitude very quickly. That -- so that's really time consuming, but that's probably only half of my role. The other half of my role is purely communication and management tasks like it takes up half of my time. It's supposed to be 20%. But in terms of what I actually do like responding to e-mails, pulling people into meetings like giving counseling sessions on performance and following up with people getting to know people so that I can anticipate future needs in terms of promotion, training, behavior management counseling support relocation to a different project assignment to teams, like I need to know people really well so that I can preempt I can need to be able to see into the future. So I'm like, "Oh, I think you'd really like to do this, Jordan, do you want to try it? And they're like, what is that about? I don't understand. And I happen to be right because I've analyzed them to the point where I'm probably a little bit ahead of where they are sometimes. And when that works, that works really well and you keep that person because you're looking after them.
          <br><br>
          JS: Absolutely.
          <br><br>
          DS: Yes. So like half, of course, software, half random comms management demos like...
          <br><br>
          JS: And which aspects of that work do you find the most challenging?
          <br><br>
          DS: As part of the core software engineering work, when you do a delivery to a customer, I'm only working in a research and development prototype stage, so the delivery requirements are much lower. It can quite literally only work sometimes. And that's bad, but not -- no one is using the system. So there's no threat to life yet. So that's fine. But packaging all of that up and running through a test event with the customer would probably be the most challenging bit. I've done a lot of that over the last 7 years, most recently with this prototype system because we're doing something wildly different. It's a bit broken. So when you take -- when you package the whole system up, you've got your 45 terabytes of system that you're deploying across lots of hardware. There's -- you're running 32 screens, you fill out a lab. Things go wrong. Like did you know that LED panels that overheat display rainbow spontaneous I didn't know that, but I know that now when I tried to test 32 displays on a display or running together. That's just a

          random hardware problem like -- it just so happened because of what we were doing, and it was hot and there was an air conditioning event that was closed and all of a sudden an aggressive rainbows. -- like that type of troubleshooting you won't get until you are smashing the system in a testament. That is, yes, a formal testament, I would say, is the most challenging piece.
          <br><br>
          JS: Awesome. Okay. And finally, can you share an example of the work you do that captures the essence of the IT industry the best?
          <br><br>
          DS: What do I think is most representative of the IT industry. So exactly that. probably working in a scrum team to solve software tickets. So the classic loop is I've got a 2 x print. We do our backlog grooming at the end of the previous sprint. Backlog grooming is where you meet with your leads and the subject matter experts from within and without your team and the stakeholders, and you sort of work out, okay, what do we need to do? Let me add some details of these tickets and documentation, organize them a little bit, then the team goes into split planning, and you pull in the work that exactly fits in the next 2 weeks, the team decides. And the product owner is talking to the customer. and they decide what's available to pull from. So that -- like what work should I do, but not when and how And the team decides -- well, the when is sort of the 2 weeks. So like the when is fixed, but the how is okay, I'm going to do these tickets, they're going to feel like the 2 weeks, the team commits to it. And then you spend 2 weeks powering a way at software tickets. Things like doing coded views for other engineers, testing your stuff, writing in a test right in code. That's probably the most representative of software engineering. The IT industry is obviously about 1,000x bigger than that. But from a software engineers perspective, that's a very common experience, that kind of what I've just described where you're working with. Normally, it's a group of 5 to 8 people. You get to know each other really well because you're sort of you're working almost all the time with these same people trying to get to that end of the 2 weeks with a working incremental software. So not half done, not 94% done, signed off tested. And then you go and you do a sprint showcase or a Sprint review at the end, and you show -- physically show the working software on the screen to the product one that asks you to do it. And they -- with the customer, like if you shouldn't really have the customer in there, but we do because defense likes to show off, you've got the customer there, and you like, this is what we achieved in the SulesAnd there will be in a Zoom meeting like this one and I'll screen share, and I'll show them all about it. That's probably the most representative example I've got.
          <br><br>
          JS:That does sound yes. definitely what I have heard as well and Yes, absolutely. All right. Thank you for -- that was really -- yes, opening.
          <br><br>
          JD: Yes. I just wanted to ask as well, what we do you change what you do? Like when did you know this is what you said at...
          <br><br>
          DS: Yes. So I was probably 13, and I've just never deviated from the same thing. I don't change my mind a lot. So I'm one of those really boring people that has an idea of what a good life would look like at 13, and I knew it would be STEM married with kids, -- and I knew it would be defense because my cousin worked in defense and he was someone looked up to at the time. So he was 7 to 17 and starting inning, and that was 13 notes like that through the call. And I've always liked up in building computers since sales 8 or 9 with my dad. So -- I don't have a strong natural skill set here. It's personal interest on them. So my skill set is people social. We still -- I was following an arts drama almost acting quiet for a long time until '13, '14. And I switched to Stene I realized there was limited hope for me there. I need to do something that sets up the life of the children I don't have yet. Because the core thing about being boring is you have less to think about. I didn't want to travel at care, don't do holidays as just power through to an outcome. And I've just done that like with literally no deviation. So I needed good grade as a sea student because I was social and I didn't care about school, I played a lot of thought. And at 14, I stopped playing all sports. I greatly reduced the social time and then I just focused on my school work, and I went like from as to like a pluses pretty quickly. The school is pretty easy like year talk to you even have -- and then because I had succumb to the competitiveness of needing to be the top student, I want were really about high schools where I get like busted a lot by people and then no one did only scil work. So I was like, "Oh, well, I would just trying to be the best students, which was easy because no one didn't work. So I felt good because I got to #1 with little effort. And then I did that the 8, 9, 10, 11, sales like A pluses all the time for every subject. 12 got a bit hard because I'm not as smart as I think I am. And subjects like specialist mass were cognitively beyond me to get that high growth. I'm not naturally gifted at that shift. I just enjoy doing it. So I killed myself to get a B+ like I'm like talking 4 hours a day, 7 days a week or 3 hours a day, 7 days a week on that subject, and the other 3 subjects would fit into the normal school time murders and I was working full time in McDonald's almost at this point then Yes, so like a lot going on. And then once I got into Union was so much easier than year 12. I just didn't need to put the same hours in that. So I worked full time moved out of home, kind of just followed my plan, I guess. But the reason why IT was always where I wanted to be as complex problem solving. -- very, very broad. If you got board with something, you would literally died before you hit all of the major disciplines. If you spend 1 minute doing every subfunction of IT, you would die of natural courses. There's so much like it's not like other industries where like if you are in a physical trade, there's like 1 billion different things that you can install, but like their complexity similarities are quite similar for some of them. So if you consider like a carpenter, there's 1 billion ways that you can cut wood and build a certain structure. The problem solving is in following the plan that you've got given. But there's also the problem solving complexity and software following the plan. But there's so many tools like it's not just 100 screw drivers, there's millions of libraries that are completely different -- that's just libraries like what about physical computers and peripherals that you could use or what's the example that I do, like I do defense systems integration. The stuff that I'm integrating doesn't -- is so different, like you can't Google anything that I do because it's classified stuff. So it's like
          
          Yes, the diversity, I think, is so big like people say, it's really big, like it's so much like it's incomprehensivey diverse. If you get board with something, then -- and you can't work out what to go to next. That just means you're not aware of the next step, not that there isn't one for you, right? The only people I would push away from IT are those that don't have an interest in understanding how things work. It is definitely how things work industry, not how people work. right? So if you care more about people and you don't care about how things work, then it's a really poor choice. If you care about both like I do, I can't decide what I want to do more like I've just described a person that's very much split down the middle. I don't know what I want to do. I'm not particularly brilliant the technical stuff. I just enjoy it. So -- but IT lets me do that as well because somebody has to talk to the customer. And it's not the guy of the basement that the sun in 6 years. So Yes, it's diversity and complex problem solvent. And the third thing is ever since as a little boy. You want to build Corsi that has a purpose. So for me, I think about like Australian sovereign safety, I care about that personal. A lot of people like you work for an arms manufacturer, and all you do is make a BoMs.dit's like that's a little bit like saying, gee, everyone that works in mining personally causes climate change and like, well, when turbines have copper and then you did copper out of the ground from the mine -- like it's about perspective for us. So that the perspective for purpose is important, but it's definitely the diversity. Like it's like a kid in a candy shop type thing, like you could just try a different lolly and you would die before you tried them all. So that's really cool. And you don't get that with a lot of other jobs. So that's -- yes, those are probably my 3 points there. That's a very big question. I answered this a lot with my university students.

          JS: Very good question.Yes. No, don't so much for that. I was -- I think that was more than we even needed...

          JD: Yes. Thank you so much. It's been really helpful. It will be really helpful to everyone wasn't able to watch nobody at least be able to watch the recording as well.
