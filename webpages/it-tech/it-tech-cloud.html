        Quantum Cloud Computing (Clouds, Servers, Services)
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted"><small>William Croft</small></p>
      <p>
        Cloud-based quantum computing is the use of quantum computing resources which are available through the cloud. This field features the 
        combination of two of the most influential technologies in IT, merging the powerful processing power of quantum computers with the accessibility 
        and flexibility of the cloud. 
        <br> <br>
        Quantum computers are a fairly recent addition to the world and still considered to be in its infancy, with the first successful implementation 
        being achieved in 1998 by Isaac Chuang, Neil Gershenfeld and Mark Kubinec (Holton, 2021). These machines work on an entirely different basis 
        compared to regular, or classical computers, harnessing quantum physics in their processing, allowing them to function at significantly higher 
        speeds and with greater and more complex calculations. However, the raw power that they offer goes underutilized and is yet to be commercialized 
        for a wider range of users. This is because quantum computing only has limited use so far, constrained predominately to solving highly complex 
        problems like that of quantum physics, or questions in biology researchers may struggle to answer with classical computers. 
        This is one of the greatest advantages quantum computers have over its classical counterparts – the speed and power at which they are able to 
        solve such intricate issues. Though this isn’t to say that someday quantum computers will replace the trusty laptop or the dusty workplace 
        desktop, in fact, any problem a classical computer can solve can also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that a quantum 
        computer can solve can theoretically be solved by a classical computer, albeit in a drastically longer time. This means that quantum computers 
        hold no additional advantages over classical systems, they perform the basics of computation no better than the average computer, 
        but they still hold value in the potential of where they can be applied. Quantum computing could see great applications beyond just research, 
        furthering development of cryptography, simulation of quantum systems and artificial intelligence or finding use in industries like 
        pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and finance. Actually, obtaining access to a quantum computer poses a significant challenge to businesses and 
        academics alike, which is where quantum cloud computing comes into play. The development of quantum cloud computing may possibly affect academics 
        and research in the future where quantum computers are more accessible.
        <br><br>
        To begin with, ‘Quantum computing has a high cost and technical barrier to entry; therefore, its deployment is limited’ (Dataconomy, 2022). 
        Quantum computing systems are costly and time-consuming to develop, deploy, manage, and maintain. This is why we only see big companies like 
        Google, Amazon and Microsoft take the lead in research, development and usage. The skill floor involved is also quite high as the field 
        necessitates the development of new calculations and logic skills in software engineers and development tools are often tied to individual 
        technologies. This is why cloud services are being providing access to these quantum computers, opening the point of entry for developers, 
        researchers and businesses to an accessible degree.
        <br><br>
        Businesses and academics will be able to gain access to a wide range of quantum computer services through the cloud to solve difficult or 
        complex issues that may require greater processing. The potential user base may someday be able to practice using quantum computing on the 
        cloud without having to wait for the technology to mature and become widespread. Those who study the field will be able to understand and 
        experiment without the limits of physical hardware, much like what current cloud services provide for classical computers. Companies like 
        Google and Amazon already utilize cloud technology with quantum computing to an extent to bypass the physical component. This implies that 
        individuals as basic users may one day be able to utilize quantum computers in the cloud by making them more accessible than ever. 
        The eventuality of innovation and widespread use of quantum computers promotes development of next-generation end-user products.
        <br><br>
        Due to the advancement of technology and the invention of new solutions, many people will be unable to utilize these new technologies because 
        the learning curve will be immense and steep. The rate at which newcomers in cloud and quantum computing learn will be affected by the difficult 
        learning curve. IBM is one of the leading companies in quantum computing and started providing free access to their cloud quantum computing in 
        2016, the IBM Q Network. Over 400 thousand users are taking advantage of IBM’s quantum systems, having their 27-qubit Falcon processor, their 
        65-qubit Hummingbird processor and recently, their Eagle processor, a 127-qubit quantum processor. IBM allows users to enter instructions on a 
        normal computer that gets delivered to a quantum system hosted on their Cloud. Data gets converted so that the quantum computer can read the 
        information before translating it back so that classical computers can interpret it. IBM also offers Qiskit, a cloud-based open-source software 
        development kit made for connecting and working with quantum computers.
        <br><br>
        Other companies have also aimed to provide cloud quantum computer facilities in upcoming years, such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. 
        Amazon Bracket, announced towards the end of 2019, seeks to overcome the challenges quantum developers and researchers face by supplying a 
        fully managed quantum computing service in the cloud. Bracket allows users to write and test code on quantum computers available from different 
        providers, depending on their needs. They have also made it possible to combine the usage of quantum and traditional resources with the help of 
        the AWS Cloud. As well as establishing this as a service, Amazon has also made a physical lab for quantum research.
        <br><br>
        Due to the limitations and the progress quantum computing and cloud computing have yet to make, it may be a while until the average, 
        at-home user, like myself, gets access to a quantum computer through the cloud, or even has a reason to. The option to, regardless of reason, 
        may be available soon. A characteristic of this emerging technology is the aim of boosting research and development, rather than integration 
        into daily applications and the end-user. Laptops and Personal Computers will likely not be replaced by quantum chips, but the capabilities of 
        them will be available through the cloud to solve whatever problem we may have, just through your normal computer. Friends, family and other 
        employees of research labs and businesses will be able to see the progress of quantum computing but will still be waiting for the point where it 
        becomes fully available to industries globally.
        <br><br>
        Within the next few years, we may yet see the indirect effects of more widespread accessibility and usage of quantum computing. 
        Companies will be able to decode intricate chemical compounds and encourage research and the creation of new drugs or stronger, 
        more effective medicine, finding new solutions for otherwise untreated or underdeveloped treatments. There’s also promise in providing 
        greater encryption and security in exchanging data over the internet, and in finance trading, risk management and improving transactions 
        in terms of speed. Because quantum computing is able to handle more complex data and carry out complicated calculations quicker, 
        everyday business may benefit in saving time and being more efficient.
