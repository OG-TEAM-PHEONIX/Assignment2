      <h2>
        Autonomous Vehicles
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted"><small>JD Eru</small></p>
      <p>
        Autonomous [motor] vehicles are vehicles that contain differing levels of automation commonly referred to as self-driving or driverless cars. 
        The industry standard understanding of these levels can be found in figure 11. (SAE 2021) 
        <br><br> 
        Levels 1 and 2 are foundational levels of automation 
        that still require a human driver to control the vehicle. Tesla are currently certified level 2, while Honda and Mercedes Benz have the required 
        regulatory approval to produce level 3 automated vehicles. Level 3 still requires human intervention when requested, when level 4 is achieved this 
        will no longer be required. Car manufacturers are working towards reaching level 5 where full automation without any human intervention will be 
        required on any roads. A fully autonomous vehicle is not currently available in Australia, however varying levels of assistance are available in 
        newer cars currently being sold. This technology includes lane centring, parking assist, lane departure warnings and adaptive cruise control. 
        <br><br>
        Autonomous vehicles rely on GPS (global positioning services) combined with IMU (inertial measurement unit), LIDAR (light detection and ranging), 
        RADAR (radio detection and ranging), ultrasonic sensors, video cameras and a CPU or computer. The driver will input the desired location, the LIDAR system that is 
        typically mounted on the top of the vehicle will then scan the surroundings to determine the vehicle's position while communicating with the integrated GPS technology. 
        The vehicles software and CPU will also communicate with google maps and any other relevant mapping data to determine which route to take. The vehicle has sensors around 
        the chassis that assist in detecting things such as objects, vehicles and driving lanes. There is also a radar system to determine distance between objects and vehicles.
        <br><br>
        While the technology currently exists, there are problems and variables that need to be worked through. For example, LIDAR can faulter when the environment is icy or overcast. 
        Even without automation vehicles currently communicate with one another through lights, indicators, and horns. The advancement in autonomous vehicles could see cars communicating 
        with one another at a more advanced level.
        <br><br>
        Fully autonomous vehicles will contain life critical technology. A failure of this technology can lead to loss of life. 
        In Australia there has been one reported fatality because of vehicle automation, with multiple smaller incidents reported, however a significant amount of 
        these errors was determined to have been caused by other drivers and not the technology. (Finder 2021)
        <br><br>
        Autonomous vehicles can safely drive faster and closer to one another. This will reduce traffic and congestion on the roads. 
        For maximum efficiency 100% of vehicles need to be completely autonomous with roads and cities that are designed to support them. Realistically 
        that is not going to happen soon due to cost, current urban planning and human nature. Another important safety aspect will be the reduction in drunk drivers, 
        road rage, fatigue, speeding and general distraction. The vehicles will also have a quicker reaction time than a human driver which would reduce road fatalities.
        <br><br>
        Legislation will need to be passed to support these vehicles being on the road and an evaluation of the ethics involved would need to be completed. 
        Commonly asked question when discussing the ethics of self-driving cars are; who is at fault if two vehicles get into an accident? If the car is presented with a 
        scenario that will result in killing the person in the car or a pedestrian, who will it choose? And who will make that decision?
        <br><br>
        There will also be a disparity between those that can afford self-driving cars and those who cannot. The initial cost of these vehicles will be high, especially 
        vehicles that are utilising LIDAR technology. As technology advances the cost will eventually be reduced but the initial cost of licencing and mass production will be significant. 
        Affordability will not only be determined by the individual car owner but the location of where someone lives. Not every country is going to be able to accommodate or adapt their 
        infrastructure to support these vehicles. It is also important to remember that countries have varied reliance on motor vehicles. For example, driving in Australia is different 
        from driving in Vietnam. Countries that rely on scooter transportation will be less likely to adapt to autonomous vehicles meaning people in those countries may never 
        benefit from any advancements.
        <br><br>
        The Trucking industry will be most impacted by this technology. Autonomous vehicles will be safer and quicker as the vehicle will only need to stop for refuelling. 
        This will result in a significant loss of employment over the sector which currently employs 212,000 Australians (Labour market insights 2021) 
        The flow on fiscal impact will be significant as those employed in the trucking industry will need to be redeployed into the workforce. Despite the loss of employment, 
        companies will be eager to adapt this technology. Logistically, the quicker and safer freight moves the more money that can be made. 
        Money spent on wages can then be spent on increasing companies' fleets. The reduction in human drivers will also have a flow on effect to petrol stations and roadhouses. 
        Vehicles will be able to take themselves to the petrol station, the most efficient time to do this will be when the roads are quiet overnight. 
        The future of driverless cars could also mean the end of petrol stations as we currently know them.
        <br><br>
        Life Expectancy in Australia is increasing (AIHW 2022) advancements in autonomous vehicles will impact the disabled and elderly community significantly. 
        This technology will allow people to be more self-sufficient and independent. People will no longer need to rely on others to get from one location to another and 
        as elderly people account for a considerable number of road accidents, reducing their need to drive without taking away their independence will make roads safer for everyone. 
        Parents could also utilise this technology to drive their children to and from school and the need for public transport may reduce.
        <br><br>
        It is worth noting that this technology has been promised for some time. While the immediate advancements in the next few years may go unnoticed by the average Australian. 
        Many new cars already contain various level 1 and 2 technologies. This has been a slow process with the roll out of these features gaining minimal attention 
        from those outside of the IT or motor industries. As the level of automation increases the roads will become safer for all with future assisted technologies to reduce 
        accidents and near misses. Another positive impact will be time gained back in people's day with a reduced commute time due to lessened congestion and the ability to multitask 
        while “driving.”
