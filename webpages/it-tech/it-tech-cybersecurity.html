        Cyber security is the use of technology to defend against cyberattacks on systems, networks, programmes, devices, and data. 
        Its objective is to reduce the cyberattack risk and protect from unauthorised access to technology, networks, system, devices, and data.
        <br><br>
        Let’s learn what these cyber threats are to get a better understanding of them. 
        The most common cyber-attacks include malware, spyware, phishing, data breaches, DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service), 
        and ransomware, however, they are not limited to these because of their evolving nature. 
        Their main goal is damaging or disrupting services or stealing your credentials for financial or political gains. 
        These cyber-attacks are usually in the form of malicious in nature.
        <br><br>
        Now how would we implement and protect ourselves from several types of cyber-attacks? There are simple measures you can take in protecting yourself which are listed in Table 8.

        Cybersecurity is on the rise, especially with the development of technologies that are used in different sectors of the industry heavily rely on the 
        Internet and the use of the internet is vastly multiplying on a significant scale. 
        Medical, Financial and regardless of what size of business you hold, it is important to protect yourself from cyber-attacks. 
        Businesses cannot just afford to do the bare minimum to protect themselves and their clients from cyber-attacks. 
        Ransomware attacks on businesses have turned into a legitimate industry where attackers effectively lock out users of their systems and data before 
        demanding and getting paid hefty ransom payments to regain access. At the same time, these attackers are carrying out significant data breaches, 
        gathering vast quantities of private information, and requesting ransom payments to prevent its release or sale. 
        Australian Cyber Security Centre suggest that at least one cybercrime report is made approximately every eight minutes in Australia in the financial year 2022. 
        The most recent attacks on our most recognisable organisations such as Optus, Energy Australia, and Medibank.
        <br><br>
        More malware varieties now have polymorphic traits, which means they frequently alter their distinguishing characteristics to avoid any detection. 
        They can change file names or the type. The malware intends to spread and infect the device and go undetected in the system.
        <br><br>
        The impact of cyber security breaches may face significant fines. There are also non-financial costs to be considered, like reputational damage. 
        Cyber attackers may face substantial consequences like hefty fines and imprisonment, which is only fair for the financial and reputational loss companies and individuals may suffer. 
        Cyber-attacks continue to grow in complexity, with attackers using an ever-expanding variety of tactics. These include social engineering, malware, and ransomware.
        <br><br>
        One of the effective ways to manage your cyber security is by reinforcing regular 
        training given to the employees to recognise cyber security threats as their responsibility, as the main cause of data breaches is human error.
        Human Error is the leading cause of data breaches. Therefore, you must equip staff with the knowledge to deal with the threats they face. 
        It is, therefore, imperative that businesses equip their staff with the necessary knowledge and tools to face these ominous threats.

        The damages of these impacts are significant, new studies show that approximately the world economy loses more than $1 trillion each year due to cybercrime. 
        The new changes in the world such as COVID-19 have also been a major factor, especially for those who are working from home. 
        Since, this period of covid the cloud network has expanded to provide a suitable environment to communicate for organisations, remote workers are being targeted 
        more frequently as it is getting easier due to their network not being as secured compared to an organisation’s security protocols.
        <br><br>
        The penalties for companies who are affected by cybercrimes are about to get more expensive if they don’t take it seriously now, the regulations for not complying to protect 
        sensitive information will result in serious outcomes. Organizations will need to have proactive plans against these cyber-attacks. 
        There is a huge frequency of cybersecurity jobs, according to a study done by cybercrime Magazine, there was a 350 per cent growth in cybersecurity positions from 2013 to 2021.
        <br><br>
        In this day and age world, every single individual is linked to a service or an organisation that uses the internet, 
        without it our world would be quite complex. In saying that technology has improved our life by making things as simple as 
        possible with the invention of smartphones, smartwatches, etc., however, the scams on the internet over the years have also increased. 
        According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, we have lost $425 831 035 and most of that was coming from investment scams, 
        and most numbers of it were from phising. These numbers involve the members of our society who have been misled by false promises or threats.
        <br><br>
        It is very important to protect our data since it involves our identity, our image, and our reputation. 
        If our information is available to anyone it could seriously impact an individual's life, from threats, extortion and theft. 
        All the personal information that you leave on the internet creates a digital footprint, and the data such as age, gender, and location should only be allowed 
        to share whenever you feel comfortable doing so. However, cyber-attacks are always on the look-out to deprive you of that right. 
        Therefore, I suggest all of my family members take great caution in preventing themselves from being cyber victims.
