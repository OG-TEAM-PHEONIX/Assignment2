          Project Idea - Parents Pantry
      </h1>
      <p>
        In assignment 1 each member of Team Phoenix created their own project idea. For assignment two we have chosen to create a mobile app. 
        Below is an explanation of our proposed app which will be specifically aimed at parents.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As a parent, planning activities to do with your children can be overwhelming. 
        The internet is full of options but finding something suitable is time consuming. 
        This time could be better spent interacting with your children. Screentime is not recommended for children under the age of two, and it is recommended that parent's 
        model healthy relationships with devices by limiting their screentime in front of children. (Raising Children 2020) While it may seem 
        counterintuitive to develop a mobile app to help parents limit their screentime, that is exactly our plan.
        ‘Parents Pantry’ will be an interactive mobile app that provides users with personalised activity recommendations. 
        It will be quick and easy to use, meaning less time on your phone and more time for everything else in your life.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The most successful apps create value for the user. There must be a need that isn’t being met. In this case the answer in connivence and connection. 
        There is a gap in the market currently as there does not appear to be any other app that is like what ‘Parents Pantry’ will be.
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3 class="h4">What will the app look like?</h3>
      <p>
        ‘Parents Pantry’ will have a simple user interface with clear and minimal directions. 
        It will be designed in a way that does not overstimulate or overwhelm the user. 
        There will be clear input controls and navigation components for ease of use and users will get to choose generic graphics to represent each child.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4">What will it do?</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the app is to provide tailor made recommendations to the user based off the information they supply.
        <br><br>
        Users would create an account that has basic details such as name, email and mobile. 
        It would then allow the user to create a profile for their child. 
        The profile will allow them to add their child's name along with their month and year of birth and the app will be for newborns – 5 year old's.
        <br><br>
        The library would contain a database of activities. Each activity would have variables such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Age of child</li>
          <li>Materials</li>
          <li>Environmental factors</li>
          <li>Pantry items  </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

            <h3 class="pt-2">Environmental Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Environmental factors would typically be what the parent needs to update each time they use the app. 
              The user would be asked what they prefer from a list of variables such as;
            </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>Indoor play</li>

            </svg>
            <h3 class="pt-2">Pantry items</h3>
              <p>
                Pantry items would be anything that can be used that also needs to be restocked. This would not only include options from your pantry but resources such as;
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>Paint</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Paper</li>
                <li>Chickpeas</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>After participating in an activity that involves pantry items you would be prompted to check the following;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have any of the item left?</li>
          <li>Does the item need to be removed from your apps pantry?</li>
          <li>Do you want to add this into your shopping list for the future?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During the user's initial login, they would receive a tutorial on how to use the app. 
          They would be encouraged to update their pantry and materials on a regular basis and have the options for reminders 
          to be set at whatever frequency they wish. The reminders could include a grocery list, or updates when new activities are added.

      <section class="container pt-3">

        <h3 class="h4">What is the goal of the app?</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of the app is to provide convivence to the user, to make their day simpler and to help parents spend more quality time with their children. 
          The apps data bases will be a wealth of knowledge and it will be a singular search point to find that only recommends things inside of the users requirements.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="h4">What are possible plans for the apps future?</h3>
        <p>
          If the app was successful and well received there would be multiple options for expansion. One option could be an algorithm that makes a recommendation as you open the app. 
          The recommendation would consider your child's age, your “pantry” and the activities you have previously completed and rated highly.
          <br><br>
          Another possible option for the future would be to extend the user base. The app would initially be targeted at parents and carers, 
          but a future state of the app could be focused on early childhood educators and school teachers if the age parameters were to expand. 
          The possibility of earing ad revenue at some stage would also seem likely.
        </p>

      <section class="container pt-3 pb-3">
        <h2>Tools and Tech</h2>
        <p>
          On a surface level the app is simple. There will be a large data set that is filtered and presented to the user. 
          The key to an app like this being successful will be making the app user friendly and visually appealing and to have a data source 
          that is always growing with additional activities being added on a frequent basis.
          <br><br>
          Databases will be storing a user’s log-in details such as their username or email and password. 
          Their own personal details as well as their children’s will need to be entered and stored, such as name, age, 
          number of children and so on. Additional databases will be added to hold inventory items related to a specific user, 
          containing user-inputted information such as materials and pantry items.
          <br><br>
          To store user information and host the mobile application itself, a remote server will ideally be required in some form. 
          A PaaS-based hosting platform will be the best for the scope of this mobile app, as it reduces coding time and allows for easy, 
          focused mobile development. This means the host will also be handling the physical servers, storage, operating systems, networking firewalls and security. 
          An example of a potential PaaS hosting service is Microsoft Azure.
          <br><br>
          The local internal storage of the device will also be taken into consideration to handle temporary information and will be purged or reset each 
          time the user logs out of the app. This will likely relate to user-inputted searches and filters, such as environmental factors.
          <br><br>
          The core of the app will depend on the software algorithm that takes the aforementioned factors and creates suggestions for the user based on them. 
          This will essentially be a user-initiated search with applied filters from both user account data and user-input data. 
          The search will scan another database that contains suggestions with related filter keys. This part will require an algorithm coded with a 
          language that can talk to databases, such as Python or SQL.
          <br><br>
          Creating wireframes and mock-ups will be necessary to facilitate the development of the app, and Adobe XD is an available service that excels 
          in this department, however, there are cheaper alternatives out there. Adobe XD can further be used for the prototyping stage of development, 
          but Proto.io is another useful alternative. The actual User Interface and creation of the app will be a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
          For a more streamlined and efficient development, React Native is a popular JavaScript Framework for mobile development. 
          A clean and simple to use user interface will be important as the aim of the app is to help parents spend less time searching on their phones. 
          To optimize the User Experience, user testing will be crucial to implementing an intuitive and easy-to-use UX. 
          Feedback from testers throughout the entire development cycle will be necessary to ensure the app is built to a publication standard.

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        The required skillset to create ‘Parents Pantry’ will vary. To release a minimum viable product, we will need a mixture of general and technical skills. 
        Some of the required general skills include; strong communication, organisation, teamwork, troubleshooting, planning, decision making and creativity. 
        Being a smaller group, it is important that there is a clear plan and direction throughout the development stage. Decision making is also important, 
        whilst the aim will be to make these as a group, in a realistic environment it is not uncommon for a decision to come down to one person, 
        the ability to do this directly impacts timeliness of project completion. 
        <br><br>
        The required technical skills would include but are not limited to;

        <ul>
          <li>
            Security, users will create accounts that contain personal information so it will be necessary to have adequate security to protect log in details and any other sensitive information.
          </li>
          
          <br>
          <li>
            Graphic Design, the ideal end state of the app would include graphics for each “ingredient”. This will help make the app more accessible and easy to use.
          </li>

          <br>

          <li>
            Programming language. The app will require a coded algorithm to talk to the database. A decision on which language to be used has not been made but it could include python, L or swift.
          </li>

          <br>

          <li>
            Git, GitHub will be utilised to collaborate on the project and would be a required skillset.
          </li>
