              Jordan is a current student at RMIT Online studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and a part of Team Phoenix. Living in Cairns, Far North Queensland, his hobbies include 
              As a hobby, I like to make music! More specifically, I like to produce, record, mix and master songs by myself and others. I can also play the drums! Apart from music, I like to play golf, and video games and I have a real passion for motorbikes. I've always been interested in IT as I grew up playing games, which eventually turned into trying to figure out how they worked, so I went into the rabbit hole a little deeper. My experience is quite little, though I feel my variety of knowledge in many areas will prove helpful towards our team project/s.
              <br><br> The Campaigner personality is known for their creative and charismatic character, idealism and enthusiasm. Campaigners excel at facing challenges, coming up with ideas and brightening the lives of those around them. As this was my test result, I have high hopes that I will be able to slot into my group nicely. Using an enthusiastic and idealistic approach to challenges and participation in general, I strongly believe my personality mixed with my other group members will allow us all to excel and create a great working environment. Building on this, I took a creativity test - my score was 87.3 which is toward the higher end. For myself, seeing this result really proved that I had a Campaigner personality and further strengthened it. Finally, the learning style test indicated that I am a visual learner. In any case, this learning style will work well when watching my group mates sharing screens and demonstrating how to do something if one or all of us don't quite understand - even just screen sharing a word document with the meeting agenda will allow a visual learner to remember this.
